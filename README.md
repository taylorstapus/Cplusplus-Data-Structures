# Summary 
Worked on creating data structures to read information in a file and sort them properly with direction in the main function. These instructions include, Search, Insert, Order(pre, in and post), and Remove. The types of data structutre that are given are a linked list, hash table and binary search tree.

# What I did well
I believe I did a good job with initializing the constuctors of the code 

# What I can improve
I need to work on creating code to read an inputed file correctly and implementing that into the data structure that I am using. I struggles with creating the main function to properly read and sort the data given 

# Skills acquired from these projects
The skills that I honed with these assignments with structuring constuctors in a particular class and making sure I am properly calling one function in another. I believe these skill will help me with future projects.
